	 * This is only supported by independent trees: since it is not an edit, it could not be sent to other clients of a collaborative tree.
	 *
	 * The replaced content must not have been changed by a commit retained in the tree's history:

	 * Nothing is released in that case: remove the listeners first.
	 * Listeners on other nodes, including ancestors of `node`, are not affected and keep receiving events for changes under `node`.
