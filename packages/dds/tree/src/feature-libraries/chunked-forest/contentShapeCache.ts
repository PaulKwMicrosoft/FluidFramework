 * A shape derived from schema (see `tryShapeFromNodeSchema`) only exists when the schema fixes the layout of the
 * whole subtree. Much content does not qualify (any optional field, sequence field or field allowing several types
 * prevents it), yet many such subtrees share a few concrete layouts. This cache provides shapes for those layouts.
 *
 * A node can have a content-derived shape when it has no value and each of its fields holds between one and
 * {@link ContentShapeLimits.maxFieldLength} children which all have the same shape.
 * The shape is determined by the node's type and, for each of its fields in order, the field's key, the shape of its
 * children and their number.
 * Fields which are encoded incrementally (see {@link IncrementalEncodingPolicy}) are never part of a shape,
 * so that their content keeps its own chunks.
 *
 * Shapes are interned in a trie of {@link ContentLayout}s: one root per node type, and one transition per field.
 * Equal layouts therefore get the same {@link TreeShape} instance, found with one map lookup per field.
 * Layouts which can not have a shape are remembered as well, so content that never fits is rejected quickly.
 *
 * The cache's size is bounded by {@link ContentShapeLimits}.
 * Its entries depend on the stored schema and on the schema-derived shapes it was used with,
 * so it must be discarded when the schema changes.
